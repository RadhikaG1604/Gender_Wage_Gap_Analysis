# Gender_wage_gap_analysis

## Introduction

The Gender Pay Gap is a pervasive global issue that transcends borders, cultures, and socio-economic backgrounds, impacting individuals irrespective of their professional pursuits. Informed by the groundbreaking research of 2023 Economics Nobel Prize awardee Claudia Goldin (Refer article - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-women-earn-less-than-men-economic-historian-wins-nobel-for-work-on-gender-pay-gap/), we endeavor to investigate the nuanced relationship between gender pay inequalities and economic growth, drawing on the gender pay gap dataset from Kaggle (view here)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/gender-pay-gap-dataset] at our disposal. The dataset comprises Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata spanning three decades from 1980 to 2010. With 344,287 rows and 234 columns of raw data, a meticulous data cleaning process is imperative. 

## Hypothesis and Key Questions

To guide our analysis, we hypothesize a significant gender pay gap, influenced by factors like experience and education level, regional and industry disparities, and variations across racial and ethnic groups, aiming to explore their temporal evolution.

Below are our key questions based on our hypothesis:
1. Does a significant wage gap exist between men and women ?
   - Overall distribution of hourly wage
   - How does the average/median vary between men and women ?
   - Is the observed wage disparity specific to certain occupation or industries ?
   - Do industries have an equal or acceptable proportion of men and women ?
   - How does the level of wage disparity vary between industries ?

2. What are the underlying causes that contribute to this wage disparity ?
   - Work Experience
   - Education Level
   - Racial Disparities
   - Working Hours

3. How proportionate are the differences in these factors with the difference in wages and how has this evolved over the years ?

## Key Findings and Recommendations

Key findings include 
1. Significant Gender Wage Gap: The analysis confirms a substantial wage gap between men and women across various dimensions including industries, occupations, education levels, and work experience.
2. Gender Representation in Industries: Industries show clear disparities in gender representation, with sectors like education and healthcare dominated by women, while fields like construction and
transportation have fewer female workers.
3. Factors and Wage Disparities: Factors such as work experience, education level, and racial disparities do not fully explain the wage gap; men consistently earn more than women even when controlling for
these variables.
4. Impact of Working Hours: Men tend to work slightly more hours than women, contributing to differences in wages. This disparity underscores the broader issue of unequal pay for comparable work.
5. Trends Over Time: There's a modest improvement in gender wage equality from 1981 to 2011, suggesting progress through educational advancements and increased female representation in certain industries.

## Call for Action/Recommendations:
1. Promote Gender-Neutral Recruitment and Advancement Practices: Implement unbiased recruitment processes and offer unconscious bias training.
2. Industry-Specific Wage Equity Initiatives: Conduct pay equity audits and establish clear wage guidelines within industries.
3. Support Flexible Work Arrangements: Advocate for policies like telecommuting and parental leave to support work-life balance.

## Final Comments on Analysis and Future Work:

The study identifies persistent challenges in gender wage equality, highlighting the need for continued research into industry-specific policies and societal factors influencing the wage gap. The dataset's limitations include lack of detailed demographic data, potential sampling bias, and the absence of dynamic factors like evolving policies or societal norms.
